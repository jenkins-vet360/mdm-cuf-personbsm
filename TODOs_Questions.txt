API Questions & Cleanup
-----------------------
- Why aren't the optional/required in swagger showing up properly?
- The PersonBio error codes aren't correct in the error keys HTML.  We need to solve this, likely through getting that
person.xsd separated out in our project, and when we generate it we should omit generating it's JSR 303.  Or research
if there is some other way to not @Valid recurse the graph.  Or maybe we simply don't use JSR 303 validation in this
project since validation is simple and we just return back constants for the few checks we have.
- When we get a correction back from BSM, how do we sync it back up with the correct address/telephone/email on the PersonBIO?
    - What ID does our app send to BSM for this?
- How to handle overridden bio coming back from BSM?
